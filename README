Web Development Interface is an abstract superset of various modern web technologies.  
Based on solid and reliable fundaments of the programming world it create a unique  
environment for fast and easy web modules development.  
Keeping the native complexity of server-oriented architecture and dynamic client application  
design the library provides an advanced interface to create and maintain your project.  
Accessibility and flexibility in software construction process are the primary goals of the framework.  
  
WDI is composed of several components, such as Server, Processor and Controller.  
The central module is the Processor which makes translation of WDI code possible.
